The Data is all about the car analysis from CardDekho.com

This data is collected from 'Car Dekho'.

The following details of cars are included in the dataset:
1) Car name
2) Year
3) Selling Price
4) Kms driven
5) Fuel
6) Seller type
7) Transmission
8) Owner
The Road Map/Step-to-step process for analysis of the data consists of importing libraries, uploading the data, data preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis(EDA), feature selection, train test split, data scaling, model building, and lastly not the least I have checked the model performance.

Lastly, I have visualized the data using the visualization tool i.e., Tableau which I have uploaded in my Tableau public account and here is the link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aashok.aacharya/viz/CARDATAANALYSIS/CARDATAANALYSIS

As I came to the conclusion that the most use car brand based on all the variables is Maruti.
